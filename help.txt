Paste a text into input.txt to analyze vocabulary, save and close the file.

The text vocabulary will be placed into output-new.txt, so the file's content will be replaced. 

The base.txt will be updated - new vocabulary will be added to the existent vocabulary list. 

Make sure you save base.txt elsewhere or clean the file if you don't want to mix the vocabulary lists.

Click the ANALYZE button to start.


In case you want to merge two bases - save one base.txt file as ouput-new.txt in the program directory,

place the other base.txt into the program directory. Try not to edit base.txt or problems may come.

You can make your own list of unknown words. To do so place a list of the words you know to known_words.txt

each word on a new line.

All .txt files used in this program should be encoded with UTF8.


Once you get the output-new.txt open it in Excel and copy the words you know into another file and save it.

This list you may place into the known_words.txt file. After that click on the New Words button and Vocabuilder

will compare known_words with base.txt and give you list of the uknown words. You can find the list in the 

unknown_words.txt. 


If you click Translate button Vocabuilder will translate the first 100 of the unknown_words and place the translation

into translated words.txt. Take these words and add them to your AnkiDroid carddeck and improve your vocabulary!
